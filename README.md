# Crystal Collector Game
jQuery coded game for 4th assignment of the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp

## Instructions
1. Player is given a random number at the start of the game. 
2. There are four clickable crystals at the bottom of the page. By clicking on them, the player adds a specific amount of points to the Total Score at the bottom of the page. 
3. The player wins by matching the Number to Guess with the Total Score. The player loses the game if the Total Score is more than the Number to Guess. 
4. The value of each crystal is hidden from the player until clicked. 
5. Each time the game starts/restarts, the value of each crystal and Number to guess will change. 

### Hint: 
The crystals will only be numbers from 1 - 12. Good luck!
